# simple-calculator
A simple command-line calculator built with Python. Supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.


# ðŸ”¢ Simple Calculator in Python

This is a basic command-line calculator application written in Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Exponentiation (`^`)

## ðŸ§® How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and then choose an arithmetic operation. It calculates and displays the result based on the user's input.

## ðŸ“‹ Sample Code

```python
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
operation = input("Choose the operation (+, -, *, /, ^): ")

if operation == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == '/':
    result = num1 / num2
elif operation == '^':
    result = num1 ** num2
else:
    print("Invalid Input")

print(f"The result is {result}")

ðŸ’¡ Example

Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 3  
Choose the operation (+, -, *, /, ^): *  
The result is 30.0
